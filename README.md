# C4InterFlow - Architecture as Code Samples

This site provides a visualisation UI for the Diagrams generated by [C4InterFlow](https://github.com/SlavaVedernikov/C4InterFlow) based on Architecture as Code (AaC) expressed using C4InterFlow's AaC **Domain Specific Language** (DSL) either in **C#**, **YAML** or **JSON**.

## E-Shop sample (from C# Source Code)
[E-Shop sample](dotnet-eshop) contains **AaC** and the **Diagrams** generated by C4InterFlow based on [E-Shop sample .NET application ](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop)
### Architecture as Code (AaC)
AaC is generated from C# source code
- [C#](https://github.com/SlavaVedernikov/C4InterFlow/tree/master/Samples/dotnet.eShop/dotnet.eShop.Architecture/SoftwareSystems)
- [YAML](https://github.com/SlavaVedernikov/C4InterFlow/tree/master/Samples/dotnet.eShop/dotnet.eShop.Architecture/Yaml)
